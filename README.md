# WHUS2-CR
This is a Sentinel-2A cloud removal dataset in which the paired cloud and cloud-free images are from different regions of the world. The types of land cover are rich and the acquisition dates of the experimental data cover a long time period (from 2015 to 2019) and all seasons.
The details of the dataset are introduced in datadoc.docx
The dataset can be downloaded on:  https://pan.baidu.com/s/1pqiQIX8ikRwJpke9z1BltQ.  Extraction code: s2cr.

Distributions of training and testing data. Training areas are marked in white, testing areas are marked in black. The landcover background is derived from 300 m annual global land cover time series from 1992 to 2015 (Defourny et al., 2017)
